Description: Fit occupancy models in 'Stan' via 'brms'. The full variety of 
   'brms' formula-based effects structures are available to use in multiple 
   classes of occupancy model, including standard single-season models, models 
   with data augmentation for never-observed species, dynamic (multiseason) 
   models with explicit colonization and extinction processes, and dynamic models 
   with autologistic occupancy dynamics. Formulas can be specified for all relevant
   distributional terms, including detection and one or more of occupancy, 
   colonization, extinction, and autologistic depending on the model type. Several
   important forms of model post-processing are provided.
